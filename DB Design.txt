Database Design

The Database has been implemented using MongoDB. The Database has two collections:

1. Users - contains the registered user details.

User Model:

	User = {
		firstname: String,
		lastname: String,
		organization: String,
		username: String,
		password: String
	}

	User.index({username: 1}, {unique: true});

2. Events - contains the events/sheets created by the user.

Event Model:

	People = {
		firstname: String,
		lastname: String,
		email: String,
		phone: Number
	}
	
	What = {
		name: String,
		when: String,
		people_needed: Number,
		people_signedup: [People]
	}
	
	Event = {
		title: String,
		owner: String,
		description: String,
		isDeactivated: Boolean,
		what: [What]
	}
	
	Event.index({title: 1, owner: 1}, {unique: true});
