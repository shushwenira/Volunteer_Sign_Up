Volunteer Signup

Volunteer Signup is a website where users can create signup sheets for various events in their organization. Event organizers need to register in the website before they can create volunteer signup sheets for events. The Users can create multiple signup sheets for different events. For each sheet the user can specify different tasks and the number of volunteers needed for each task. After creating a sheet, the user can share the link of the sheet to potential volunteers. Volunteers can sign up for events without having to register at the site.
Functionalities:

 - The users can keep a track of the volunteers signed up for each task in any event by going to the Events tab.
 - Once the required number of volunteers have signed up for a task, no one else will be able to sign up for that task. Even if the link is available with someone, they will not be able to sign up.
 - In case, an event gets cancelled and the user no longer needs any volunteers, the user can cancel the sheet. If a sheet gets cancelled, the volunteers signed up for that event will get a mail notifying them regarding the cancellation of the event.
 - If any Volunteer wishes to withdraw from any event, he/she will have to notify the sheet owner to drop his/her name from the list. Then, the event owner must clear the slot assigned to that volunteer. Once the slot is cleared, the volunteer receives an automated mail.
 - An Event details can be modified after its creation using the edit button. More tasks can be added. Volunteer needed can be increased or decreased (not less than already registered)
 - The Volunteer list can be downloaded as CSV file for each event.
